# EthosForge

Production-grade fraud detection pipeline implemented as interactive Jupyter notebooks. EthosForge contains a complete end-to-end workflow: data loading, cleaning & preprocessing, feature engineering & selection, model training (ensemble), evaluation, and visualization. The notebooks are ready to run locally or in Google Colab — change the dataset paths inside the notebook and run.

Badges

- Repository: https://github.com/LakshmiSagar570/EthosForge

Repository contents (important)
-------------------------------
- EFColab.ipynb — Main notebook with the full pipeline and report.
- EFColab_fixed.ipynb — Fixed/cleaned version of the main notebook (recommended to run).
- (Generated by the notebooks when executed) ethosforge_dashboard.png — dashboard visualization saved by the notebooks.

If other files should exist (data, requirements, license), they are not present in the repository root and must be added.

Project summary
---------------
EthosForge implements a fraud-detection workflow. Key elements implemented in the notebooks:
- Data loading from Excel files (train/test Excel files; notebook contains the comment "MODIFY THESE PATHS").
- Data cleaning, missing-value handling, and preprocessing.
- Feature selection producing a 22-feature set.
- An ensemble model labelled in the notebook as "Ensemble (GB+RF+LR)" — an ensemble of Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation with confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and summary metrics.
- Visualization and a saved dashboard image (ethosforge_dashboard.png).
- Deterministic behaviour via RANDOM_STATE = 42.

Data & features
---------------
The notebooks expect Excel input files for training and testing. The notebooks check for a target column named `IsFraud`. Modify the paths in the first cells before running.

Feature set (as listed in the notebook)
1. Amount
2. Counterparty_Account
3. OrderingCustomer_Account
4. Beneficiary_Account
5. is_international
6. is_high_amount
7. is_weekend
8. is_night
9. is_business
10. TxnFrequencyLast7Days
11. freq_log
12. is_high_freq
13. TotalAmountLast7Days
14. total_7d_log
15. IsRepeatBeneficiary
16. IsHighRiskCountry
17. risk_amount
18. amount_freq_ratio
19. MessageType_enc
20. Currency_enc
21. CounterpartyRegion_enc
22. (one other feature to total 22 — notebooks list 22 features)

Example data summary and final performance (from a notebook run)
- Training samples: 3855
- Testing samples: 887
- Features: 22
- Final performance (example run from notebook):
  - AUC-ROC: 0.6470
  - Accuracy: 0.6392
  - Precision: 0.4333
  - Recall: 0.4120
  - F1-score: 0.4224

These numbers are included in the notebook outputs and represent a single experimental run — re-run after updating/preparing your datasets to reproduce or improve.

Requirements
------------
Suggested Python environment (recommended):
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Lab / Notebook

Suggested Python packages (pip)
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- openpyxl (for reading .xlsx)
- xlrd (if reading older Excel formats)
- notebook or jupyterlab
- papermill (optional — for parameterized execution)

You can create a virtual environment and install dependencies with:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn openpyxl xlrd jupyterlab papermill
```

Quick start — run the notebooks locally
--------------------------------------
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LakshmiSagar570/EthosForge.git
cd EthosForge
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment and install dependencies (see Requirements above).

3. Open the fixed notebook (recommended):
```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```
Open `EFColab_fixed.ipynb` (or `EFColab.ipynb`) in the browser.

4. Edit the top cells to set the `train_path` and `test_path` variables to point to your Excel datasets. The notebook includes an explicit "MODIFY THESE PATHS" comment.

5. Run the cells from top to bottom. The notebook will:
- print progress steps (STEP 1, STEP 2, ...).
- save a visualization image as `ethosforge_dashboard.png`.
- print a final report with the metrics shown above.

Run in Google Colab
-------------------
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. Upload the notebook file (`EFColab_fixed.ipynb`) or open directly from GitHub via File → Open notebook → GitHub and paste the repo URL.
3. Upload or mount your dataset files (or use Google Drive).
4. Update dataset paths in the first cell and run.

Headless / automated execution (optional)
-----------------------------------------
You can execute notebooks headlessly using jupyter nbconvert or papermill. Example using nbconvert (will execute and overwrite the notebook output):

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute EFColab_fixed.ipynb --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 --output EFColab_fixed.executed.ipynb
```

Example using papermill to pass parameters (recommended if you want parameterization):
```bash
pip install papermill
papermill EFColab_fixed.ipynb EFColab_run.ipynb -p train_path data/train.xlsx -p test_path data/test.xlsx
```

Notes and next steps
--------------------
- The notebooks contain many diagnostic prints and saved figures intended for exploration. To productionize:
  - Extract modeling code into Python modules / scripts.
  - Add a requirements.txt or environment.yml for reproducibility.
  - Add a LICENSE file (no license detected in the repo root) — recommended: MIT if you want permissive open-source licensing.
  - Add tests and CI (GitHub Actions) to validate notebook execution or the extracted scripts.
  - Add example datasets (or a small sample) under data/ so others can run the notebooks immediately.

Troubleshooting / tips
----------------------
- If Excel read fails, ensure you have `openpyxl` (for .xlsx) or `xlrd` (for .xls) installed.
- Use the `RANDOM_STATE = 42` value used in the notebooks to reproduce behavior.
- If long-running cells time out when executing headless, increase `--ExecutePreprocessor.timeout` or split the notebook.

Contributing
------------
This repository currently contains interactive notebooks. To contribute:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Add scripts or modularized code (preferably outside notebooks).
3. Add a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.
4. Submit a PR with clear description and tests or an executed notebook showing results.

License
-------

Acknowledgements
----------------
- Built using common Python data science libraries (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
- Notebook is designed to be run interactively for exploration and demonstration of a fraud-detection modeling workflow.

If you'd like, I can:
- generate a requirements.txt file with explicit pinned versions based on common compatible sets,
- produce a lightweight Python package structure extracting the pipeline from the notebooks into runnable scripts,
- or open a PR that adds a LICENSE and requirements file to this repo — tell me which and I will prepare the changes.
